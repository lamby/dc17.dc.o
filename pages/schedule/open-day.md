Open Day
========

Open Day at DebConf17 is aimed at the general public, where events of interest
to a wider audience will be offered.

DebConf17's Open Day will be a great opportunity for users of Debian and Free
Software to meet our community and learn about our work and our vision.

The schedule for Open Day will be announced in May 2017.
