Submitting an Event
===================

Submit an [event proposal][] and describe your plan. Please note, events are not
limited to traditional presentations or informal sessions (BoFs). We welcome
submissions of tutorials, performances, art installations, debates, or any
other format of event that you think would be beneficial to the Debian
community.

[event proposal]: <https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/new/>

Please include a short title, suitable for a compact schedule, and an engaging
description of the event. You should use the field "Notes" to provide us
information such as additional speakers, scheduling restrictions, or any
special requirements we should consider for your event.

Regular sessions may either be 20 or 45 minutes long (including time for
questions), other kinds of sessions (like workshops) could have different
durations. Please choose the most suitable duration for your event and explain
any special requests.

You will need to create an account on the site, to submit a talk. We'd encourage
Debian account holders (e.g. DDs) to use [Debian SSO][] when creating an account.
But this isn't required for everybody, you can sign up with an e-mail address and
password.

Timeline
========

The first batch of accepted proposals will be announced in April.
If you depend on having your proposal accepted in order to attend the 
conference, please submit it as soon as possible so that it can be considered 
during this first evaluation period.

All proposals must be submitted before Sunday 4 June 2017 to be evaluated for
the official schedule.

Topics and Tracks
=================

Though we invite proposals on any Debian or FLOSS related subject, we have some
broad topics on which we encourage people to submit proposals, including:

- Blends
- Debian in Science
- Cloud and containers
- Social context
- Packaging, policy and infrastructure
- Embedded
- Systems administration, automation and orchestration
- Security

You are welcome to either suggest more tracks, or become a coordinator for any of 
them; please refer to the [Content Tracks wiki page][] for more information on that.

Code of Conduct
=============
Our event is covered by a Code of Conduct designed to ensure everyone's safety
and comfort. The code applies to all attendees, including speakers and the content
of their presentations. For more information, please see the [Code on the Web][], and
do not hesitate to contact us at [<content@debconf.org>][] if you have any questions
or are unsure about certain content you'd like to present.

Video Coverage
==============

Providing video of sessions amplifies DebConf achievements and is one of the
[conference goals][]. Unless speakers opt-out, official events will be streamed
live over the Internet to promote remote participation. Recordings will be
published later under the DebConf [license][], as well as presentation slides
and papers whenever available.

especially our Platinum Sponsor [Savoir-Faire Linux][]. DebConf17 is still accepting sponsors;
