Visa Application process
------------------------

Other attendees need to apply for a visa. Visa applications don't need to be
made in-person — there is no visa interview — they can be done by courier or
online. Some countries citizens are charged fees for a visa, for others the visa
is free of charge.

Sadly, the only way to open the visa form provided by the Canadian government is
to use Adobe Reader. Since Adobe Reader is a proprietary tool that does not work
on Linux, we recommend you use a computer running either Mac OS or Windows to
fill out the form. Once the form has been filled, you can send it on your Linux
machine and continue the visa application process online.

Conference attendees should apply for an ordinary tourist visitor visa. If you
need an invitation letter, please send your request to visa@debconf.org and make
sure to include your full name, passport number and expiration date as well as
your physical address.

If you need to state the name and the address of the institution inviting you,
please use theses:

Name: *Conférence DebConf17 Montréal*
Address: *33-6640 av. Fielding Montréal (Québec) H4V1N3 Canada*

Please note that this is not the address of the venue, but the registered
address of the non-profit we created for DC17.

You can start the online visa application process [here][].
