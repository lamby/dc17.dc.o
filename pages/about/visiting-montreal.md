Visiting Montreal
=================

Montreal's airport (codenamed YUL) is the third-busiest airport in
Canada. [Direct flights](http://www.admtl.com/en/flights/direct-flights)
are provided from a lot of major European and South American cities.
The airport is located within the city on the [mid-western section](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/11027582#map=14/45.4688/-73.7463)
of the island of Montreal.

Going from the airport to the downtown area can be achieved by a
[dedicated bus line](http://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/more-about-747-aeroport-p-e-trudeau-centre-ville-shuttle)
for 10 CAD$, by taxi or by taking a Uber.

Visas
=====

Requirements for all visitors to Canada

* A valid and acceptable passport or travel document for your intended stay.
* At least one blank page (two to be safe) in your passport for endorsements
  important
* A valid visa or Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA), if required
* Sufficient funds to pay for your day-to-day expenses during your stay
* A return or onward ticket

Countries requiring visas
-------------------------

Since November 10th 2016, people who don't require visas to enter Canada still
need to fill in an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA). Exceptions include
U.S. citizens and travellers with a valid Canadian visa.

Many nationalities are exempt from requiring a visa to enter Canada. Citizens of
these countries may visit Canada for up to 6 months without a visa. This
includes most of Western Europe and USA.

You can find if you need a visa by visiting [this website](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas-all.asp).

Visa Application process
------------------------

Other attendees need to apply for a visa. Visa applications don't need to be
made in-person — there is no visa interview — they can be done by courier or
online. Some countries citizens are charged fees for a visa, for others the visa
is free of charge.

Sadly, the only way to open the visa form provided by the Canadian government is
to use Adobe Reader. Since Adobe Reader is a proprietary tool that does not work
on Linux, we recommend you use a computer running either Mac OS or Windows to
fill out the form. Once the form has been filled, you can send it on your Linux
machine and continue the visa application process online.

Conference attendees should apply for an ordinary tourist visitor visa. If you
need an invitation letter, please send your request to visa@debconf.org and make
sure to include your full name, passport number and expiration date as well as
your physical address.
