The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause
to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is
called Debian.

An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your
computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is
the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping
and lets you start other programs.

Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a
piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of
programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and
other software.

Debian comes with over 50 000 packages (pre-compiled software that is bundled up
in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager
(APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages
on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of
it free.
