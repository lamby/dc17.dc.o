Applying for a Bursary to DebConf
=================================

There are a few different types of bursary available for DebConf, funded from
different budgets:

* Debian funded bursaries are available to active Debian contributors.
* Debian diversity bursaries are available to newcomers to Debian/DebConf.
  Especially from under-represented communities.
* GSoC and Outreachy interns have bursaries available from their respective
  organizations (via Debian Outreach).

Debian funded Bursaries
-----------------------

Any member of the Debian community is welcome to request a bursary (sponsorship)
to attend DebConf. As in previous years, we will do our best to offer sponsored
food and accommodation to Debian contributors, but this assistance is subject to
demand and available funding.

If you are applying for a travel bursary
----------------------------------------

We need to decide how to spend a limited amount of money in a way that maximizes
the benefit to the Debian project. This shouldn't discourage you from applying,
but please give us the information we need to make good decisions. In these
instructions "tell us" refers to filling in the "details of my bursary request"
box on the registration form.

* Tell us what you think your most important or interesting contributions to
  Debian in the past two years are. We'll look at [contributors.debian.org](https://contributors.debian.org),
  but it doesn't always tell the whole story.
* Tell us what your plans are for next year, and how attending Debconf will
  help.
* Honestly assess your level of financial need. This is not easy, but it plays
  an important role in our ranking process.
* Give us an estimate of your travel expenses. This is also the maximum amount
  of funding you are requesting. In general this amount should reflect the most
  economical form of transport to the venue. If it's higher for some reason,
  tell us about that. If it's lower because you (or someone else) will pay part,
  tell us about that too.
* If there is someone who knows your contributions to Debian well, and would put
  in a good word for you, tell us their name and ask them to write to us
  directly, at [bursaries@debconf.org](mailto:bursaries@debconf.org).
* If your main contribution to Debian is helping with DebConf, please ask
  someone from the appropriate team to let us know how much they need you at
  this year's DebConf.

If you are applying for a bursary for accommodation or food
-----------------------------------------------------------

We're looking at [contributors.debian.org](https://contributors.debian.org) to
get a rough idea of your activity in the last few years. If you're happy with
the picture that gives, then you don't have to tell us anything more.

If you want, you can tell us more about your recent activity in Debian, or your
plans for the near future.

Everyone who is granted travel bursaries will also be granted funding for
accommodation and/or food if they ask for it. So if you provided information
above, just make sure you checked the right boxes. Note that if you told us you
"Absolutely cannot attend" DebConf without a travel bursary, we'll assume you
only need accommodation and/or food if the travel bursary is granted.

If you are applying for a bursary for accommodation or food for DebCamp, make
sure you tell us (in the "Details of my bursary request" box) your plans for
DebCamp. DebCamp is intended for focused work on Debian; please emphasize in
what way (e.g. opportunities for collaboration and/or solitude) being at DebCamp
will help you get things done you wouldn't otherwise do.

Diversity Bursaries
-------------------

The goal of Diversity Sponsorships is to bring new people to DebConf — people
just getting started in free software or with Debian, contributors who are
making non-coding contributions, and contributors who are trying to make it to
their first DebConf. If you're interested in being considered for a diversity
sponsorship, please tell us a bit about yourself and why you want to come to
DebConf:

* Is this your chance to make your first contribution?
* Do you run Debian and want to learn more about the project and how to get
  involved?
* Are you passionate about free software, and excited to be a part of the Debian
  community?

We would especially like to hear from:

* Women (cis, trans, queer), non-binary and genderqueer individuals, and
  transmen
* Residents from African countries, countries outside of Australia, North
  America, and Western Europe, and people from racial/ethnic minorities in their
  country of residence
* Individuals over the age of 35

Full diversity sponsorships will provide approximately $ 2 780 (CAD) / € 2 000
(EUR) / $ 2 270 (USD). Accommodation and food are paid for, out of this, as well
as travel.
