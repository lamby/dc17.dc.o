title: Proposing speakers for DebConf17
---

As you may already know, next DebConf will be held at Coll√®ge de
Maisonneuve in Montreal from August 6 to August 12, 2017.
We are already thinking about the conference schedule, and the content
team is open to suggestions for invited speakers.

Priority will be given to speakers who are not regular DebConf
attendees, who are more likely to bring diverse viewpoints to the
conference.

Please keep in mind that some speakers may have very busy schedules and
need to be booked far in advance.
So, we would like to start inviting speakers in the middle of September
2016.

If you would like to suggest a speaker to invite, please follow the
procedure described on the [Inviting Speakers page] of the DebConf wiki.
