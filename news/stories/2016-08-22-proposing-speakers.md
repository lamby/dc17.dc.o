title: Proposing speakers for DebConf17
---

As you may already know, next DebConf will be held at 
Collège de Maisonneuve in Montreal from August 6 to August 12, 2017. 
We are already thinking about the conference schedule, and 
the content team is open to suggestions for invited speakers.

Priority will be given to speakers who are not regular DebConf attendees, 
who are more likely to bring diverse viewpoints to the conference.

Please keep in mind that some speakers may have very busy schedules 
and need to be booked far in advance. So, we would like to start 
inviting speakers in the middle of September 2016.

If you would like to suggest a speaker to invite, please follow the procedure 
described on the [Inviting Speakers page] of the DebConf wiki.
