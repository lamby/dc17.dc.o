title: Savoir-faire Linux Platinum Sponsor of DebConf17
---

We are very pleased to announce that [**Savoir-faire Linux**][] 
has committed support to [DebConf17][] as a **Platinum sponsor**.

*\"Debian acts as a model for both Free Software and developer
communities. Savoir-faire Linux promotes both vision and values of
Debian. Indeed, we believe that it\'s an essential piece, in a social
and political way, to the freedom of users using modern technological
systems\"*, said Cyrille BÃ©raud, president of Savoir-faire Linux.


Savoir-faire Linux is a Montreal-based Free/Open-Source Software company
with offices in Quebec City, Toronto, Paris and Lyon. It offers Linux and
Free Software integration solutions in order to provide performance,
flexibility and independence for its clients. The company actively contributes
to many free software projects, and provide mirrors of Debian, Ubuntu, Linux
and others. 

Savoir-faire Linux was present at DebConf16 program with a talk about Ring, its
GPL secure and distributed communication system. Ring package was accepted in
Debian testing during DebCamp in 2016 and will be part of Debian Stretch.
OpenDHT, the distributed hash table implementation used by Ring, also appeared
in Debian experimental during last DebConf.

With this commitment as Platinum Sponsor, 
Savoir-faire Linux contributes to make possible our annual conference,
and directly supports the progress of Debian and Free Software 
helping to strengthen the community that continues to collaborate on 
Debian projects throughout the rest of the year.

Thank you very much Savoir-faire Linux, for your support of DebConf17!
