title: Download our Brochure — Become a Sponsor
---

DebConf is the annual developers’ conference of the Debian Project, 
one of the largest Free Software projects worldwide. 
Debian is non-commercial and vendor-independent.
DebConf allows developers from all over the world, who all volunteer their time, 
to gather once a year and concentrate on the development and improvement 
of the Debian distribution. 

DebConf is organized solely by volunteers; 
no conference fee is asked of the participants in general. 
Thus, DebConf depends on sponsors and donations.

Would you like to become a sponsor? 
Do you know of or work in a company or organization that may consider sponsorship?

Please have a look at our [sponsorship brochure][] (or a summarized 
[flyer][]), 
in which we outline all the details and describe the sponsor benefits.

For further details, feel free to contact the 
[sponsors@debconf.org][] with any leads.
